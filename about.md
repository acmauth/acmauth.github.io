The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) is the world&#39;s first and largest scientific and educational computing society. It was founded in 1947 only one year after the unveiling of ENIAC, the first general purpose electronic computer. The scope of ACM is to deliver resources that advance computing both as a science and as a profession. ACM provides the computing field&#39;s premier Digital Library and serves its members and the computing profession with leading-edge publications, conferences, and career resources.

The AUTH ACM Student Chapter is the official student chapter of ACM at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece (AUTH) and is based in the Department of Informatics. It was founded in December 2008 with the aim of

  * informing students about the latest achievements in computer science and engineering,
  * promote research in undergraduate and graduate level,
  * promote participation in international research and programming competitions
  * invite renowned professors
  * create a group of dedicated people interested in exploring the vast field of computers and the computing science

The chapter&rsquo;s activities are offered voluntarily, with no funding, by chapter members and officers taking into account our country&rsquo;s poor financial, cultural, educational and academic crisis. We believe creativity and generousness can help resolve our problems.

The petition for recognition of the AUTH ACM Student Chapter was created and submitted by Ioannis Paparrizos (Chair) at October 2008, with Prof. Athena Vakali and Prof. Anastasios Gounaris as sponsoring faculty members and Nikolaos Arvanitopoulos (Vice-Chair) and Dimitrios Mpouzas (Treasurer) as the first members and officers.

Since then, AUTH ACM Student Chapter has expanded to more than 25 official members and has expanded its activity to several organized events, talks and forming its own development teams.
