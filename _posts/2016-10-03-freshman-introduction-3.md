This week our Chapter introduced the first year of Computer Science students to the faculty and the chapter itself!

We welcomed the new students to our school, introduced them to what ACM does and the activities and events of our chapter.

If you want to ask us something you can either straight talk to us at the university, [contact](/contact) us.
