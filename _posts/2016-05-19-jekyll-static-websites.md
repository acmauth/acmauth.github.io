## About Jekyll

Jekyll is a Ruby-based framework that enables its users to build simple, static and blog-aware webpages without the need for a database.

You can erect your own websites, quickly and easily using Markdown, Liquid and/or HTML/CSS.

Last, you can readily deploy your site to github pages in few simple steps.

For more, come and join us in our workshop!
